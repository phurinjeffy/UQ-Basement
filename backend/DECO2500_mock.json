      "topic": "Human-Computer Interaction",
      "question_type": "essay",
      "sample_answer": "The Gulf of Execution refers to the difficulty users face in translating their intentions into actions on a system. Sarah experiences this as she struggles to locate and input travel details due to unclear field labels. The Gulf of Evaluation is the difficulty in interpreting system feedback. Sarah faces this when the search results are presented densely without clear sorting or filtering options, making it difficult to assess which flight is best."

      "topic": "Human-Computer Interaction",
      "question_type": "essay",
      "sample_answer": "To reduce the Gulf of Execution, the website should provide clearer field labels and a more intuitive layout to help users easily identify where to enter information. Dropdown menus with auto-suggestions for city names could also help. To reduce the Gulf of Evaluation, the website should implement sorting and filtering options on the results page, allowing users to sort by price, departure time, or direct flights. Using clear visual distinctions for important information and providing tooltips can help users evaluate their options more effectively."

      "question_type": "short_answer",

      "topic": "User Experience Research",
      "question_type": "essay",
      "sample_answer": "An Affinity Diagram would group interview data into categories such as: 'Learning Experience' (hands-on vs digital), 'Social Interaction' (collaboration and connection), 'Skill Development' (critical thinking vs data literacy), 'Engagement and Enjoyment' (fun activities vs efficiency), and 'Educational Outcomes' (understanding vs real-time data). Each category would contain relevant quotes and observations from both participants, showing the positive and negative impacts of technology on science education."

      "topic": "Human-Computer Interaction Design",
      "question_type": "essay",
      "sample_answer": "Fitts' Law, which states that the time required to move to a target area is a function of the distance to the target and the size of the target. When redesigning the cut button, making it larger and positioning it closer to where users naturally look or interact would reduce movement time and errors, improving usability. This principle ensures that frequently used buttons are easily accessible and clearly distinguishable."

      "topic": "Cognitive Science in HCI",
      "question_type": "essay",
      "sample_answer": "As part of the HCI complex system, humans have motor and cognitive limitations that affect interface interaction. Fitts' Law accounts for human motor precision and movement speed. When a button is larger and closer to the user's current focus point, it reduces the cognitive load of searching and the motor effort required to accurately click. This accommodates human visual attention span and motor control capabilities, leading to more efficient system interaction."

      "question_type": "essay",
      "sample_answer": "1. Users with motor impairments - may require specialized input methods beyond standard clicking\n2. Visually impaired users - may rely on screen readers or keyboard navigation instead of visual button placement\n3. Elderly users with reduced dexterity - may have different motor control needs than accounted for by standard Fitts' Law\n4. Users with cognitive disabilities - may be overwhelmed by interface changes or require consistent layouts regardless of efficiency"
